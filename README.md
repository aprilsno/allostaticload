# Allostatic Load Scores in the SWAN Study

This repo contains my final project in BIOS669: Working with Data in a Public Health Research Setting, a course I completed at UNC Chapel Hill in Spring 2023.

The primary objective of this project was to reproduce the findings from “A Longitudinal Analysis of Allostatic Load among a Multi-Ethnic Sample of Midlife Women: Findings from the Study of Women’s Health Across the Nation” by Dr. Laura Chyu and Dr. Dawn Upchurch. The original paper is available in the Additional Files directory of this repo.  Chyu and Upchurch utilized data from the Study of Women’s Health Across the Nation (SWAN) at baseline to create cumulative allostatic load scores across 10 different biomarkers. They also observed trends in allostatic load across the study period. I have derived these allostatic load scores using the Methods section and replicated Tables 1 (Biomarker and Allostatic Load Distribution at Baseline) and Figure 1 (Mean allostatic load by wave) from the original manuscript. All tables and figures, including an additional Figure 2, are available in the Output directory.

Please see the Project Write-Up document for more information on navigating this repo. A brief presentation is available in the Additional Files directory.
